      "content": "What is Zero Padding Zero padding is a technique used in convolutional neural networks where additional pixels with a value of zero are added around the borders of an image. This allows convolutional kernels to slide over edge pixels and helps control how much the spatial dimensions of the feature map shrink after convolution. Padding […] The post The Statistical Cost of Zero Padding in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) appeared first on MarkTechPost.",
