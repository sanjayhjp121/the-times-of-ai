      "content": "In 2025, Amazon SageMaker AI saw dramatic improvements to core infrastructure offerings along four dimensions: capacity, price performance, observability, and usability. In this series of posts, we discuss these various improvements and their benefits. In Part 1, we discuss capacity improvements with the launch of Flexible Training Plans. We also describe improvements to price performance for inference workloads. In Part 2, we discuss enhancements made to observability, model customization, and...",
