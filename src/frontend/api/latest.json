      "description": "In deep learning, classification models don’t just need to make predictions—they need to express confidence. That’s where the Softmax activation function comes in. Softmax takes the raw, unbounded scores produced by a neural network and transforms them into a well-defined probability distribution, making it possible to interpret each output as the likelihood of a specific […] The post Implementing Softmax From Scratch: Avoiding the Numerical Stability Trap appeared first on MarkTechPost.",
