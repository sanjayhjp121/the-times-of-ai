We walk through a three-layer framework—identity, instructions, and knowledge—that transforms Quick Suite chat agents into intelligent enterprise AI assistants. In our example, we demonstrate how our chat agent guides feature discovery, use enterprise data to inform recommendations, and tailors solutions based on potential to impact and your team’s adoption readiness.",
